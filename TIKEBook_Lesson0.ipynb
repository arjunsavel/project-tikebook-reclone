    "## What is TIKE?\n",
    "\n",
    "TIKE stands for the Time series Integrated Knowledge Engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "TIKE uses a web-based platform, called JupyterHub, which enables users to run Python Notebooks and other software remotely in a web browser without needing to install anything on your local computer. Notebooks are a convenient way of packaging code, its outputs, and visualizations. TIKE is intended for astronomical researchers (or students like you!) to access and analyze data from NASA's Kepler or TESS missions. You can find more info on TESS [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/tess#section-33e8b9e7-9cc2-414a-b830-c88f2b409b13). \n",
    "\n",
    "TIKE is continually maintained and updated by real humans, so if you run into issues please don't hesistate to let us know or send us your suggestions for packages and tutorials. You can do that either through the [MAST help desk](mailto:archive@stsci.edu) or [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/spacetelescope/tike_content).\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- #### Wait...what is Github? \n",
    "GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on coding projects from anywhere. And you're in luck! Github hosts a beginnner course on how to get started here: https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github.  -->"

    "## What is the \"cloud\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"cloud\" is a term used to describe a global network of servers, each with a unique function. The cloud is not a physical entity, but instead is a vast network of remote servers around the globe which are hooked together and meant to operate as a single data ecosystem. In other words, the cloud refers to servers that are accessed over the internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### So...whats a server? \n",
    "A server is a computer or computer program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network. This can be a physical computer somewhere, or a virtual instance. Think of the server as the waiter in a restaurant, where your data is the food. Like in a restaurant, if there are a lot of people trying to order food (or query data) at one time, it can overwhelm the server and the service will be slower. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, inside a cloud you'll also find something called a \"bucket\", these are basically the data structures that hold your data on the cloud, all the data on a cloud must be contained in a bucket. You can use buckets to organize your data and control access to your data, but unlike directories and folders, you cannot nest buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why would I want to work on the cloud?\n",
    "Using the cloud has several benefits, the major one being that you can access data whenever and wherever you want to, from any device, as long as you have WiFi. Additionally, working on the cloud means you don't have to download as much data to your machine, saving memory space and run time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common examples of clouds that one can host data on are: \n",
    "   - Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n",
    "   - Google Cloud\n",
    "   - Microsoft Azure\n",
    "   - IBM Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) data archive provides a copy of several large NASA data sets via Amazon Web Services (AWS) as part of the MAST AWS Public Datasets program. The data provided by MAST is free to use and download, no need for an AWS account!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the difference between working on the cloud and working on TIKE?\n",
    "TIKE allows you to acess data without having to download it to your local machine, everything you do and use can be stored on the TIKE server, it is the platform through which you can access cloud data. In essense, you don't need to understand how cloud computing works in order to utulize its power on TIKE. TIKE makes things as easy as opening up a Jupyter Notebook! "

We can do this by dividing our seconds by 3600, dividing our minutes by 60, leaving the hours alone, and adding them all up. For the declination, we can convert to degrees by dividing our arcseconds by 3600, dividing our arcminutes by 60, leaving the degrees alone, and then adding all three values together.

    "#### What is a FITS file?\n",
    "File Image Transport System (FITS) is a file format designed to store, transmit, and manipulate scientific images and associated data. It is the most widely used file type in astronomical research. A FITS file consists of one or more Header + Data Units (HDUs), where the first HDU is called the primary HDU, or primary array. The primary array may be empty or contain an N-dimensional array of pixels, such as a 1-D spectrum, a 2-D image, or a 3-D data cube. \n",
    "\n",
